                 <p > <i>it possible to travel much greater distances than what you can accomplish by just walking on foot. With an average walking pace of 3 miles per hour, a speed of up to 20 miles per hour can be achieved. This combination allows you get the exercise you enjoy by walking but also allows you to cover more ground while enjoying your surroundings in less time. Once you step on your Lopifit for the first time you will be hooked. There is an amazing feeling of peaceful relaxation along with a little rush of adrenaline that makes you want to keep riding. A relaxing stroll with the wind in your hair. Walking has never been this much fun!</i> <br> <br>
                 <b>Battery and gears</b><br><i>The strong battery (960 Wh, LG-cells) together with the Bafang engine (350w) make it possible to travel a distance of up to 50 miles per charge (depending on weather, your own weight, and terrain). With the five gears it can be switched to a speed you feel comfortable with.</i><br>
                 <b>Easy operation and very safe</b><i>Operating this is so simple, anyone can use it! We have riders from 9 to 90 who enjoy their bike each and every day. Simply set the bike for the speed you are comfortable starting on, hold the 'Auto' button to engage the treadmill, step up and simply walk with the treadmill. With the exception of the treadmill component on the bike, bikes are made with customary bicycle parts.it is equipped with regular handbrake levers on the handlebars and disc brakes on the wheel assembly to ensure safe, comfortable and smooth stopping power. </i> </p>

                 <p > <i>The specifications for PodRide are in a state of flux. This is because as we re-design PodRide to optimize for manufacture, we are taking all that we learned in building the prototype, and making it better.We are also adding improvements as suggested by our supporters, such as adding the capacity to carry a child passenger by increasing the size of the cargo area.Whilst the frame on the prototype was made from steel, the production version of PodRide will feature a frame and many custom components made from aircraft grade aluminium. This is to reduce weight whilst maintaining strength and durability.Shown below are the early draft specifications as they were originally drafted. (Note these may change without notice.)</i> <br> <br>

                 <p > <i>The body is more than just good looks but is protective in ways unavailable to conventional bicycles or motorcycles. Engineered for high visibility, the color impregnated Trylon ® composite body is designed to absorb impact. To protect against UV degradation and give an incredible shine the body is covered in Solarkote ®. Combined with an Aircraft aluminum substructure creates a Safety Cell that both deflects and absorbs impact.  When combined with optional carbon fiber panels, the increased strength and lower weight are unparalleled for efficiency and bicycle safety. Both recycled and recyclable, the ELF body changes how we move and how we think about Urban Mobility.</i> <br> <br>
                 <b>Frame/Chassis</b><br><i>Designed specifically for use in a solar/hybrid configuration, the 100% Aircraft Grade 6061T aluminum construction set the bar of advanced recumbent design. Designed without paint eliminates toxins and stainless steel hardware lowers maintenance and corrosion.  Large diameter 26” wheels smooth out the bumps, decreases rolling resistance and creates a practical ride height that inspires confidence in traffic. Dynamic Dampening Front Suspension combined with the dual-spine construction is super light, comfortable and capable of up to a 550 lb. payload. Comes with a 10 year guarantee.</i><br>
                 <b>Intelligent Energy System</b> <br><i>In addition to the UPDrive, this is an advanced evolution of the original Dual Drive. Both the motor and the pedal system operate independently and harmoniously. This allows each drive line to operate with maximum efficiency and never dependent on the other. A 750W DC Permanent Neodymium Magnet Motor routed through a 48V programmable controller is custom configured to a proprietary Brain Box providing continuous solar power whether parked or in motion. Lithium-ion Manganese batteries are made in the USA with a built-in Battery Management System (BMS) and are guaranteed for 1 year. When combined with the optional NuVinci® continuously variable transmission technology, a smooth integration of muscle and electrons is achieved unlike anything previously available. </i> </p>
